I have instructed to make some basic projects on Java Development & completed these with my best to make it successful.


NUMBER GUESSING GAME(Task 2):-
"This Number Guessing Game, developed in Java, challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a set number of attempts. It includes features like scoring, hints, and multiple rounds for added excitement."

ATM INTERFACE(Task 3):-
The ATM System project is a simple Java application designed to simulate basic banking operations. It allows users to perform essential functions such as registering an account, logging in, withdrawing and depositing money, transferring funds, checking account balance, and viewing transaction history. The project leverages core Java concepts including classes, objects, encapsulation, and input validation to create a user-friendly interface and ensure robust functionality. This system provides a practical example of how object-oriented programming principles can be applied to develop real-world applications.
